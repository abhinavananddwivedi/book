# Lévy Processes

## The Ultimate Generalization

**Lévy processes** unify everything we've learned: random walks, Brownian motion, Poisson processes, and jump-diffusions are all special cases.

**Definition**: A process $L(t)$ is a Lévy process if:

1. $L(0) = 0$
2. **Independent increments**: $L(t) - L(s)$ independent of past for $t > s$
3. **Stationary increments**: $L(t) - L(s) \sim L(t-s)$ (distribution depends only on time difference)
4. **Stochastic continuity**: $\lim_{h \to 0} P(|L(t+h) - L(t)| > \epsilon) = 0$ for all $\epsilon > 0$
5. **Càdlàg paths**: Right-continuous with left limits (allows jumps)

Lévy processes are the natural class of "time-homogeneous processes with independent increments."

## Examples We Know

All of these are Lévy processes:

- **Brownian motion**: Continuous paths, no jumps
- **Poisson process**: Jumps of size 1
- **Compound Poisson**: Random-sized jumps at Poisson times
- **Merton jump-diffusion**: Brownian + Compound Poisson
- **Stable processes**: Including Cauchy process
- **Variance Gamma**: Time-changed Brownian motion
- **Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG)**: Popular in finance

## The Lévy-Khintchine Representation

Here's the magic: **Every Lévy process decomposes into three independent parts:**

$$\boxed{L(t) = \gamma t + \sigma B(t) + J(t)}$$

where:

- $\gamma t$: **Linear drift** (deterministic)
- $\sigma B(t)$: **Brownian component** (continuous random)
- $J(t)$: **Pure jump component** (discontinuous)

The jump component is characterized by a **Lévy measure** $\nu(dy)$ which tells us:
- How often jumps of size around $y$ occur
- Can have infinitely many jumps in finite time!

### The Lévy-Khintchine Formula

The characteristic function (Fourier transform) is:

$$E[e^{i\theta L(t)}] = \exp\left[t\psi(\theta)\right]$$

where the **Lévy symbol** is:

$$\psi(\theta) = i\theta\gamma - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\theta^2 + \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(e^{i\theta y} - 1 - i\theta y\mathbb{1}_{|y|<1})\nu(dy)$$

The **Lévy triplet** $(\gamma, \sigma^2, \nu)$ completely characterizes any Lévy process!

## Types of Jump Behavior

The Lévy measure $\nu$ determines the jump structure.

### Finite Activity

$$\int \nu(dy) < \infty$$

Finitely many jumps in any finite interval. Example: Compound Poisson.

### Infinite Activity

$$\int \nu(dy) = \infty$$

Infinitely many jumps, but most are tiny. Examples: Variance Gamma, NIG.

**Intuition**: Like continuous process, but with "microstructure" of tiny jumps.

### Finite Variation

$$\int |y| \nu(dy) < \infty$$

Total jump variation is finite. Path has bounded variation.

### Infinite Variation

$$\int |y| \nu(dy) = \infty$$

Accumulation of many small jumps creates unbounded variation, like Brownian motion.

## Popular Lévy Processes in Finance

### Variance Gamma (VG)

- **Infinite activity, finite variation**
- Time-changed Brownian motion: $VG(t) = B(\Gamma(t))$ where $\Gamma$ is a gamma process
- Lévy density: $\nu(dy) = \frac{C}{|y|}e^{-\lambda|y|}dy$
- Three parameters to fit: shape volatility smile
- Computationally tractable (FFT methods)

**Use**: Equity options, capturing skewness and kurtosis.

### Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG)

- **Infinite activity, infinite variation**
- Hyperbolic distribution for log-returns
- Lévy density involves modified Bessel function
- Four parameters: very flexible
- Good fit to empirical return distributions

**Use**: General modeling when need flexible, fat-tailed distribution.

### CGMY (Carr-Geman-Madan-Yor)

- Generalizes many models
- Lévy density: $\nu(dy) = C \frac{e^{-G|y|}}{|y|^{1+Y}}$ for $y < 0$, similar for $y > 0$
- Parameter $Y$ controls fine vs coarse structure:
  - $Y < 0$: Finite activity
  - $0 < Y < 1$: Infinite activity, finite variation
  - $1 < Y < 2$: Infinite activity, infinite variation
  - $Y = 0$: Reduces to Variance Gamma

**Use**: Ultimate flexibility in modeling jump behavior.

### Tempered Stable Processes

- Compromise between stable (heavy tails) and exponential (light tails)
- Lévy density has power-law behavior near 0, exponential decay at infinity
- Captures both frequent small jumps and rare large jumps

**Use**: Modeling extreme events while maintaining tractability.

## Why Lévy Processes Matter for Finance

### Empirical Fit

Real asset return distributions exhibit:

1. **Fat tails**: $P(|R| > x)$ decays slower than Gaussian
2. **Skewness**: Asymmetric (negative skew for equities)
3. **Excess kurtosis**: More peaked at center, fatter tails

Lévy processes can match all three!

### Infinite Divisibility

Any time period can be subdivided arbitrarily:

$$L(t) \stackrel{d}{=} L(t/n) + L(t/n) + \cdots + L(t/n)$$

This mirrors the multiplicativity of returns in finance.

### Tractability

Despite complexity:

- **Semi-closed form option prices** via Fourier methods
- **Fast computation** using FFT
- **Analytical Greeks** (sometimes)
- **Efficient simulation** algorithms

The balance of realism and tractability makes them practical.

## Pricing with Lévy Processes

For stock following:

$$\frac{dS}{S} = r \, dt + dL(t)$$

where $L$ is a Lévy process under $\mathbb{Q}$, the option price satisfies:

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + (r - \psi(-i))S\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}$$
$$+ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[V(t, Se^y) - V(t,S) - S(e^y - 1)\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}\right]\nu(dy) = rV$$

This **PIDE** is generally solved using:

1. **Fourier methods**: Transform to frequency domain, solve algebraically, transform back
2. **Monte Carlo**: Simulate Lévy process paths, average payoffs
3. **Finite differences**: Discretize the PIDE on a grid

### Characteristic Function Method

For European options, use:

$$C(K) = \frac{e^{-rT}}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-i\omega \log K} \hat{g}(\omega) \, d\omega$$

where $\hat{g}$ is the Fourier transform of the payoff function, computed using the characteristic function of $L(T)$.

**Fast Fourier Transform** (FFT) makes this efficient for computing prices across many strikes simultaneously.

```

## Subordination

Many Lévy processes arise through **subordination**: time-changing one process by another.

If $X(t)$ is a Lévy process and $T(t)$ is an increasing Lévy process (subordinator), then:

$$Y(t) = X(T(t))$$

is also a Lévy process.

**Examples**:
- **Variance Gamma**: $VG(t) = B(T(t))$ where $T$ is gamma
- **NIG**: Time-change Brownian motion by inverse Gaussian

This gives an intuitive way to build flexible processes.

## Limitations and Extensions

### What Lévy processes cannot capture

- **Stochastic volatility**: Volatility itself random and path-dependent
- **Volatility clustering**: High volatility periods persist
- **Long-range dependence**: Correlations decay slowly

### Modern extensions

- **Lévy-driven SDEs**: $dX = \mu(X) dt + \sigma(X) dL$
- **Time-changed Lévy processes**: Random time changes
- **Lévy copulas**: Multivariate Lévy dependence
- **Fractional Lévy processes**: Long memory
- **Rough volatility**: Paths rougher than Brownian

These are active research areas combining stochastic calculus with other mathematical tools.

## The Full Circle

We started with:

**Random walks** → (scaling) → **Brownian motion** → (SDEs) → **Jump-diffusion** → (generalization) → **Lévy processes**

Each step added:
- **Brownian**: Continuous randomness
- **SDEs**: State-dependent dynamics
- **Jumps**: Discontinuous shocks  
- **Lévy**: Full generality of time-homogeneous randomness

All unified by:
- **PDEs/PIDEs** (analytical methods)
- **Martingales** (probabilistic methods)
- **Fourier methods** (computational finance)
- **Itô calculus** (the foundation)

This framework underlies modern quantitative finance, connecting pure mathematics, probability theory, and real-world markets in a beautiful and practical way.
