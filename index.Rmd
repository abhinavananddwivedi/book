# Preface {-}

Welcome to **Stochastic Calculus: An Idiosyncratic Approach**! This book provides a discussion regarding special features of the mathematics behind random processes like the Brownian Motion and their applications in finance.

## What You'll Learn {-}

This book covers:

- Random walks and Brownian motion
- Itô's lemma and stochastic integration
- Stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
- The Feynman-Kac connection between SDEs and PDEs
- Risk-neutral pricing and martingales
- Black-Scholes theory and the Greeks
- Jump-diffusion models
- Lévy processes

## Prerequisites {-}

Readers should be comfortable with:

- Calculus (derivatives, integrals)
- Basic probability theory (random variables, expectations, variance)
- Linear algebra fundamentals

## About This Book {-}

This book grew out of years of instruction at the PhD and MBA levels in IIMs Bangalore and Kozhikode. It reflects my idiosyncratic perspective on topics in mathematical finance and its pedagogy. The emphasis is on understanding *why* things work, not *what* the formulas are.


Each chapter builds on previous concepts, so I recommend reading sequentially, especially if you're new to the subject.
