# Preface {-}

Welcome to **Stochastic Calculus from Scratch**! This book provides a comprehensive journey through random processes and their applications in financial mathematics.

## What You'll Learn {-}

This book covers:

- Random walks and Brownian motion
- Itô's lemma and stochastic integration
- Stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
- The Feynman-Kac connection between SDEs and PDEs
- Risk-neutral pricing and martingales
- Black-Scholes theory and the Greeks
- Jump-diffusion models
- Lévy processes

## Prerequisites {-}

Readers should be comfortable with:

- Calculus (derivatives, integrals)
- Basic probability theory (random variables, expectations, variance)
- Linear algebra fundamentals

## About This Book {-}

This book grew out of an interactive teaching session focused on building intuition for stochastic calculus from first principles. The emphasis is on understanding *why* things work, not just *what* the formulas are.

Each chapter builds on previous concepts, so I recommend reading sequentially, especially if you're new to the subject.

Let's begin our journey into the beautiful world of stochastic calculus!
