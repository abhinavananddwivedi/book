This book provides a discussion regarding special features of the mathematics behind random processes like the Brownian Motion and their applications in finance. What You’ll Learn This book covers: Random walks and Brownian motion Itô’s lemma and stochastic integration Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) The Feynman-Kac connection between SDEs and PDEs Risk-neutral pricing and martingales Black-Scholes theory and the Greeks Jump-diffusion models Lévy processes Prerequisites Readers should be comfortable with: Calculus (derivatives, integrals) Basic probability theory (random variables, expectations, variance) Linear algebra fundamentals About This Book This book grew out of years of instruction at the PhD and MBA levels in IIMs Bangalore and Kozhikode. It reflects my idiosyncratic perspective on topics in mathematical finance and its pedagogy. The emphasis is on understanding why things work, not what the formulas are. Each chapter builds on previous concepts, so I recommend reading sequentially, especially if you’re new to the subject.
