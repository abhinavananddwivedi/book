# Random Walks and Brownian Motion

## Simple Random Walk

Imagine flipping a fair coin repeatedly. After each flip, you take a step: heads = +1, tails = -1. Your position after $n$ steps is:

$$S_n = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n$$

where each $X_i \in \{-1, +1\}$ with equal probability. This is a **simple random walk**.

### Key Properties

The random walk has several important characteristics:

- **Expected position**: $E[S_n] = 0$ (you expect to end where you started)
- **Variance**: $\text{Var}(S_n) = n$ (the variance grows linearly with time)
- **Asymptotic behavior**: $S_n \sim \sqrt{n} \cdot N(0,1)$ approximately, by the Central Limit Theorem

The last property tells us that even though each individual step is discrete, the rescaled position becomes approximately normal for large $n$.

## Scaling to Continuous Time

Now here's the beautiful leap: Let's speed up time and shrink the steps. 

Divide time into tiny intervals of length $\Delta t$, and let each step have size $\Delta x$. After time $t$, we've taken $n = t/\Delta t$ steps.

If we want the limiting process to have the same "spreading" behavior, we need $\text{Var}(S_n) \sim t$. Since variance adds, and we take $n = t/\Delta t$ steps:

$$n \cdot (\Delta x)^2 = \frac{t}{\Delta t} \cdot (\Delta x)^2 \sim t$$

This means we need: 

$$(\Delta x)^2 \sim \Delta t$$

or equivalently:

$$\Delta x \sim \sqrt{\Delta t}$$

**This is the crucial scaling!** Steps shrink like the *square root* of the time interval, not proportionally to time itself. This counterintuitive scaling is at the heart of stochastic calculus.

## Brownian Motion Emerges

Taking the limit as $\Delta t \to 0$, we get a continuous random process $B(t)$ called **Brownian motion** (or the Wiener process).

### Formal Definition

A stochastic process $B(t)$ is Brownian motion if it satisfies:

1. **Initial condition**: $B(0) = 0$
2. **Independent increments**: For any $t > s$, the increment $B(t) - B(s)$ is independent of all information up to time $s$
3. **Normal increments**: $B(t) - B(s) \sim N(0, t-s)$ for $t > s$
4. **Continuous paths**: $B(t)$ has continuous paths (no jumps)

The third property captures that crucial $\Delta x \sim \sqrt{\Delta t}$ scaling we derived above.

### A Shocking Fact

Despite being continuous everywhere, Brownian motion is **differentiable nowhere**. The path is infinitely jagged at every scale. 

To see why, consider the "derivative":

$$\frac{B(t + \Delta t) - B(t)}{\Delta t} \sim \frac{N(0, \Delta t)}{\Delta t} \sim \frac{\sqrt{\Delta t}}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Delta t}} \to \infty$$

as $\Delta t \to 0$. The "instantaneous velocity" is infinite!

This is why we need new mathematical tools - traditional calculus breaks down for such rough functions.

## Properties of Brownian Motion

### Quadratic Variation

For any partition $0 = t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_n = t$, consider:

$$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} [B(t_{i+1}) - B(t_i)]^2$$

As the partition gets finer, this sum converges to $t$ (not zero, as it would for smooth functions!). We write:

$$[B, B](t) = t$$

This is called the **quadratic variation** of Brownian motion.

### Markov Property

Brownian motion is a **Markov process**: The future is independent of the past given the present. Formally:

$$P(B(t) \in A \mid B(s), s \leq t_0) = P(B(t) \in A \mid B(t_0))$$

for $t > t_0$.

### Martingale Property

Brownian motion is a **martingale**: The best prediction of future position is the current position:

$$E[B(t) \mid \mathcal{F}_s] = B(s)$$ 

for all $t \geq s$, where $\mathcal{F}_s$ represents all information up to time $s$.

### Scaling Properties

Brownian motion has interesting scaling invariance:

- **Time scaling**: If $B(t)$ is Brownian motion, so is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{c}} B(ct)$ for any $c > 0$
- **Reflection**: $-B(t)$ is also Brownian motion
- **Time reversal**: The process $t B(1/t)$ for $t > 0$ is Brownian motion

These symmetries make Brownian motion mathematically elegant and practically useful.

## Historical Note

Brownian motion is named after botanist Robert Brown, who in 1827 observed the erratic movement of pollen grains suspended in water. However, the mathematical theory was developed much later:

- **1900**: Louis Bachelier used it to model stock prices (before Einstein!)
- **1905**: Albert Einstein explained the physical phenomenon
- **1923**: Norbert Wiener gave the first rigorous mathematical construction
- **1944**: Kiyoshi Itô developed the calculus of Brownian motion

This mathematical object bridges physics, biology, finance, and pure mathematics - a testament to its fundamental importance.
