# Jump-Diffusion Models

## Why Jumps Matter

Brownian motion assumes continuous price paths. But real markets exhibit:

- **Earnings announcements**: Stock gaps 10%+ overnight
- **Central bank decisions**: FX rates jump instantly
- **Black swan events**: Market crashes, flash crashes
- **Fat tails**: Extreme returns occur more often than log-normal predicts

Purely diffusive models systematically underprice out-of-the-money options.

## The Poisson Process

Before jumps, we need to count random events.

**Definition**: $N(t)$ is a Poisson process with intensity $\lambda$ if:

1. $N(0) = 0$
2. Independent increments
3. $N(t) - N(s) \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda(t-s))$ for $t > s$
4. Paths are step functions (jumps of size 1)

**Properties**:
- $E[N(t)] = \lambda t$ (average $\lambda$ events per unit time)
- $\text{Var}(N(t)) = \lambda t$
- $P(N(t) = k) = \frac{(\lambda t)^k e^{-\lambda t}}{k!}$
- Waiting times between events: exponential with rate $\lambda$

**Differential notation**:
$$dN(t) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{with probability } \lambda \, dt \\ 0 & \text{with probability } 1 - \lambda \, dt \end{cases}$$

Key property: $(dN)^2 = dN$ (since $dN \in \{0,1\}$ and $1^2 = 1$).

## Compound Poisson Process

Add random jump sizes:

$$J(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N(t)} Y_i$$

where $Y_i$ are i.i.d. random jumps (often $Y_i \sim N(\mu_J, \sigma_J^2)$).

In differential form:
$$dJ(t) = Y \, dN(t)$$

where $Y$ is drawn when a jump occurs.

## Merton's Jump-Diffusion Model

Combine Brownian motion with compound Poisson jumps:

$$\boxed{\frac{dS}{S} = \mu \, dt + \sigma \, dB + (e^Y - 1) \, dN}$$

**Components**:
- $\mu \, dt$: Deterministic drift
- $\sigma \, dB$: Continuous diffusion (Brownian)
- $(e^Y - 1) \, dN$: Discontinuous jumps

**Jump structure**:
- Jumps arrive with intensity $\lambda$
- When jump occurs: $S \to S \cdot e^Y$ (multiplicative)
- Typically $Y \sim N(\mu_J, \sigma_J^2)$ (log-normal jumps)

### Why $e^Y - 1$?

If $Y = \log(1 + k)$ where $k$ is the percentage jump:

$$S_{\text{after}} = S_{\text{before}} \cdot e^Y = S_{\text{before}} \cdot (1 + k)$$

So a 10% down move corresponds to $Y = \log(0.9) \approx -0.105$.

## Itô's Lemma with Jumps

For a function $f(S)$ where $S$ follows jump-diffusion, Itô's lemma becomes:

$$df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial S}dS + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2}(dS)^2 + [f(Se^Y) - f(S) - \frac{\partial f}{\partial S}S(e^Y - 1)]\,dN$$

The last term is the **jump correction**: actual jump minus first-order Taylor approximation.

**Multiplication rules**:
- $dB \cdot dN = 0$ (jumps and diffusion independent)
- $dt \cdot dN = 0$
- $dN \cdot dN = dN$ (only one jump at a time)

### Example: Log Price

Apply to $f(S) = \log S$:

$$d(\log S) = \left(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)dt + \sigma \, dB + Y \, dN$$

Integrating:

$$\log S(t) = \log S(0) + \left(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)t + \sigma B(t) + \sum_{i=1}^{N(t)} Y_i$$

Log price = drift + Brownian + sum of jumps. Clean decomposition!

## Risk-Neutral Pricing with Jumps

Under $\mathbb{Q}$, discounted price must be martingale:

$$\frac{dS}{S} = (r - \lambda \kappa) \, dt + \sigma \, d\tilde{B} + (e^Y - 1) \, d\tilde{N}$$

where $\kappa = E^{\mathbb{Q}}[e^Y - 1]$ is the expected jump size.

The drift adjustment $-\lambda \kappa$ compensates for jumps to maintain martingale property.

If jumps are log-normal: $Y \sim N(\mu_J, \sigma_J^2)$, then:

$$\kappa = e^{\mu_J + \sigma_J^2/2} - 1$$

### The Critical Insight

**With jumps, you cannot perfectly hedge!** 

Jump risk cannot be eliminated through continuous rebalancing. This fundamentally changes the pricing problem.

## Merton's Option Pricing Formula

For a European call:

$$\boxed{C(S, t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-\lambda'(T-t)}[\lambda'(T-t)]^n}{n!} \text{BS}(S, K, r_n, \sigma_n, T-t)}$$

where:
- $\lambda' = \lambda(1 + \kappa)$ is adjusted intensity
- $\text{BS}(\cdot)$ is Black-Scholes formula with modified parameters:
  - $r_n = r - \lambda\kappa + \frac{n\log(1+\kappa)}{T-t}$
  - $\sigma_n^2 = \sigma^2 + \frac{n\sigma_J^2}{T-t}$

**Interpretation**: Weighted average of Black-Scholes prices, each term corresponding to exactly $n$ jumps before maturity.

## The PIDE

For general derivatives, the pricing equation becomes a **partial integro-differential equation**:

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + (r - \lambda\kappa)S\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}$$
$$+ \lambda\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}[V(t, Se^y) - V(t,S)]f(y)\,dy = rV$$

The integral accounts for all possible jump outcomes, weighted by their probability density $f(y)$.

**Much harder to solve** than Black-Scholes PDE! Typically requires numerical methods:
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Fourier methods (FFT)
- Finite difference on jump-diffusion grid

## Market Implications

### Volatility Smile

Jump models naturally produce volatility smiles:
- Out-of-the-money puts protect against downward jumps → higher implied vol
- Near-the-money options less affected → lower implied vol
- Creates the characteristic "smirk" in equity markets

### Greeks

Greeks behave differently with jumps:
- **Delta** no longer perfect hedge ratio
- **Vega** has two components: diffusion vol + jump vol
- **New Greeks**: sensitivity to jump intensity ($\partial V/\partial \lambda$), jump size
- **Jump risk premium**: additional risk that can't be hedged

### Calibration

More parameters to fit:
- Brownian: $\mu$, $\sigma$
- Jumps: $\lambda$, $\mu_J$, $\sigma_J$

Pros: More flexible, fits market data better
Cons: Harder to calibrate, identifiability issues

## Extensions

### Double exponential jumps

Use asymmetric exponential distributions for up/down jumps:

$$f(y) = \begin{cases} 
p \eta_u e^{-\eta_u y} & y \geq 0 \\
(1-p) \eta_d e^{\eta_d y} & y < 0
\end{cases}$$

Allows different behavior for positive and negative jumps (market asymmetry).

### Stochastic intensity

Let $\lambda$ itself be random:

$$d\lambda = a(\lambda) \, dt + b(\lambda) \, dW$$

Models "volatility clustering" of jumps (crises come in waves).

### Jump-to-default

Special case: when jump occurs, stock goes to zero (bankruptcy):

$$P(\text{jump to default in } dt) = h \, dt$$

Used in credit risk models.

## Summary

Jump-diffusion models capture:
- Discrete shocks in addition to continuous uncertainty
- Fat tails and skewness in return distributions
- Incomplete markets and non-hedgeable risk
- More realistic market dynamics

They're the bridge between Black-Scholes and more sophisticated Lévy process models.
