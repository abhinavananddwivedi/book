# Black-Scholes Theory

## The Black-Scholes Formula

For a European call option with strike $K$ and maturity $T$, the price at time $t$ with stock price $S$ is:

$$\boxed{C(t, S) = S\Phi(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)}\Phi(d_2)}$$

where:
$$d_1 = \frac{\log(S/K) + (r + \sigma^2/2)(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}, \quad d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T-t}$$

and $\Phi$ is the standard normal CDF.

### Derivation

Under the risk-neutral measure, stock price evolves as:

$$S(T) = S(t)\exp\left[\left(r - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)(T-t) + \sigma\sqrt{T-t}Z\right]$$

where $Z \sim N(0,1)$.

The call price is:
$$C = e^{-r(T-t)}E^{\mathbb{Q}}[\max(S(T) - K, 0)]$$

After working through the integral (completing the square), we obtain the formula above.

### Interpretation

$$C = S\Phi(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)}\Phi(d_2)$$

- $S\Phi(d_1)$: Expected present value of stock *if exercised*
- $Ke^{-r(T-t)}\Phi(d_2)$: Expected present value of strike payment
- $\Phi(d_2)$: Risk-neutral probability option finishes in-the-money
- $\Phi(d_1)$: "Delta" of the option (hedge ratio)

## The Greeks

The Greeks measure sensitivities of option prices to various parameters. They're essential for risk management and hedging.

### Delta ($\Delta$)

$$\Delta = \frac{\partial C}{\partial S} = \Phi(d_1)$$

**Interpretation**: 
- How much the option price changes per $1 change in stock price
- Hedge ratio: to hedge a short call, buy $\Delta$ shares
- Ranges from 0 (deep out-of-money) to 1 (deep in-the-money)

### Gamma ($\Gamma$)

$$\Gamma = \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial S^2} = \frac{\phi(d_1)}{S\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}$$

where $\phi$ is the standard normal PDF.

**Interpretation**:
- Rate of change of Delta
- Measures convexity of option price
- Maximum at-the-money
- Hedging $\Gamma$ is expensive (requires frequent rebalancing)

### Vega ($\mathcal{V}$)

$$\mathcal{V} = \frac{\partial C}{\partial \sigma} = S\phi(d_1)\sqrt{T-t}$$

**Interpretation**:
- Sensitivity to volatility
- Options are "long volatility" - gain value when $\sigma$ increases
- Maximum at-the-money
- Long-dated options have more Vega

### Theta ($\Theta$)

$$\Theta = \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = -\frac{S\phi(d_1)\sigma}{2\sqrt{T-t}} - rKe^{-r(T-t)}\Phi(d_2)$$

**Interpretation**:
- Time decay - value lost per day
- Usually negative for long options (you lose time value)
- Accelerates as expiration approaches

### Rho ($\rho$)

$$\rho = \frac{\partial C}{\partial r} = K(T-t)e^{-r(T-t)}\Phi(d_2)$$

**Interpretation**:
- Sensitivity to interest rates
- Usually less important than other Greeks
- More relevant for long-dated options

### The Greeks Relationship

They satisfy the Black-Scholes PDE:

$$\Theta + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2\Gamma + rS\Delta - rC = 0$$

This connects time decay, convexity, and delta in a beautiful way.

## Delta Hedging

You're a market maker who sold a call option. How to hedge the risk?

### The Strategy

1. At time $t$: Hold $\Delta(t) = \Phi(d_1)$ shares of stock
2. As stock moves: Continuously rebalance to maintain $\Delta(t)$ shares
3. If hedged perfectly with correct volatility: Earn the risk-free rate

### Discrete Hedging P&L

Over small time $dt$, the P&L is approximately:

$$dP\&L \approx \frac{1}{2}\Gamma(dS)^2 - \Theta \, dt$$

- $(dS)^2$ term: Realized variance
- $\Theta$ term: Time decay

If realized volatility = implied volatility used for pricing, these balance out.

### The Catch

In practice:
- Can't rebalance continuously (transaction costs)
- Don't know true volatility in advance
- If realized vol $\neq$ implied vol, you make/lose money

This is why options trading is essentially trading volatility!

## Put-Call Parity

For European options with same strike and maturity:

$$C - P = S - Ke^{-r(T-t)}$$

**Proof**: Both sides have payoff $S(T) - K$ at maturity. By no-arbitrage, they must have equal value today.

**Uses**:
- Price puts from calls (or vice versa)
- Identify arbitrage opportunities
- Understand synthetic positions

## Implied Volatility

The market quotes option prices, not volatilities. **Implied volatility** is the $\sigma$ that makes the Black-Scholes formula match the market price:

$$C_{\text{market}} = C_{BS}(S, K, T, r, \sigma_{implied})$$

### The Volatility Smile

In practice, implied volatility varies with strike:
- **Equity markets**: Volatility skew (higher for low strikes)
- **FX markets**: Volatility smile (higher for extreme strikes)

This violates Black-Scholes assumptions! Real markets have:
- Fat tails (more crashes than log-normal predicts)
- Stochastic volatility
- Jumps

Modern models address these issues.

## American Options

American options can be exercised anytime before maturity. No closed-form formula exists!

Must solve the **free boundary problem**:

$$\max\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV, \, g(S) - V\right) = 0$$

where $g(S)$ is the exercise payoff.

### Early Exercise Premium

$$V_{American} = V_{European} + \text{Early Exercise Premium}$$

For calls on non-dividend paying stocks: Early exercise premium = 0 (never optimal to exercise early).

For puts: Early exercise can be optimal (when deep in-the-money).

## Extensions

### Dividends

If stock pays continuous dividend yield $q$:

$$C = Se^{-q(T-t)}\Phi(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)}\Phi(d_2)$$

where $d_1, d_2$ are modified to include $q$.

### Exotic Options

- **Digital options**: Pay $1 or $0
- **Barrier options**: Activated/deactivated if stock crosses barrier
- **Asian options**: Payoff depends on average price
- **Lookback options**: Payoff depends on maximum/minimum

Each requires specialized techniques!

## Limitations of Black-Scholes

1. **Constant volatility**: Real volatility varies and is stochastic
2. **No jumps**: Stocks can gap (earnings, news)
3. **Log-normal distribution**: Real returns have fat tails
4. **Continuous trading**: Transaction costs exist
5. **Known parameters**: Volatility and drift are unknown

Despite limitations, Black-Scholes is:
- A benchmark for pricing and hedging
- The foundation for more sophisticated models
- Still widely used (with adjustments)

The framework is more important than the formula itself!
